# SignalAwareRouting
This is my CS191 final project. It's UIKit based! Get XCode to build and run it. It's designed for both the simulator and iPad. 

There's a few constants to adjust in TrafficGridViewController. You can control the emission rate of cars, signal adaptation, and ideal cycle times. 

N.B.
I'm always looking for clever new ways to blend traffic signals information and routing. If you know any, open an issue or contact me.
