# SignalAwareRouting
This is my CS191 final project. It's UIKit based! Get XCode to play with it. 

There's lots of constants to play with. Especially in TrafficGridViewController. 

I'm always looking for clever new ways to blend traffic signals information and routing. If you know any, open an issue or contact me.
